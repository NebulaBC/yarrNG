# yarrNG

**yarrNG** is yarr but upgraded. This project is currently WIP, but I'm going to add more features to make yarr customizable.  

I have serious respect for projects that achieve their goal and become feature-complete, such as the original yarr or projects like runit... that said, even though I *love* yarr I also have some things I would like it to have for it to be *feature complete for me*.

I have more ideas rolling around my head, but here is my TODO list for now:

- [ ]  Importable fonts
- [ ]  PWA support
- [ ]  Multi-account support
- [ ]  Hashed passwords for accounts
